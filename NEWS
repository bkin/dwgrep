* version 0.2 [2015-02-28 Sat]
  - ELF symbol tables are supported.  New word `symbol` applicable to
    DWARF value yields ELF symbols.  Words `label`, `value`,
    `address`, `name`, `size` `binding`, `visibility` operate on ELF
    symbols.

  - C API is considerably more complete, and now used exclusively by
    the "dwgrep" command-line driver to communicate with libzwerg.  It
    is however still not considered stable and is undocumented.

  - The word `length` is now applicable to location lists.

  - Bug fixes (issues #5, #6, #7, #8, #14, #15, #16, #17, #22, #26).

* version 0.1 [2014-12-10 Sun]
