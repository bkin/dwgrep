* BUGS
** missing DW_LNE_*, DW_LNS_*
  - these can't quite have distinct domains, as they need to be
    comparable.  Better wait with implementing these until we get to
    line tables, so that it's better understood how these will need to
    be used.

** stack underruns are ungraceful
** domain comparability
   - whether domain is arithmetic is currently used for deciding
     whether it's meaningful to compare a constant this domain to
     constants of other domains.  But e.g. address and offset aren't
     comparable, but they are safe for arithmetic.  Similarly line and
     column--shouldn't be compared with one another, but are safe for
     arithmetics.  This is unlike named constants, which are not safe
     for arithmetic.

* TODO
** static analysis tools
*** overload pegging
    - We could use overload prototype declarations to mention return
      value type as well.  Then we could determine what overload will
      be chosen for each overloaded word, and dispatch it directly.

*** stack effect analysis
    - By the same token, we could statically determine that a certain
      program is invalid, because it underruns stack.  For variadic
      input argument operators (such as integrate, which is either
      ?T_DIE ->? ?T_DIE or ?T_DIE ?T_CLOSURE ->? ?()) we are possibly
      out of luck and have to fall back on runtime checking.

      - It might even make sense to turn off stack effect checking
        when we can prove that the program never underruns.

        We could also selectively turn off stack profile tracking for
        programs where we can statically determine all effects.  But
        that will be rare, any attribute access is a wild card.

      - At least stack shuffling operators need to be built in, so
        that we know that we don't lose type information after
        dup'ing.  (Without having to have something awfully generic
        like dup :: A => A A).

      - Variable binding somewhat complicates things, though we can
        probably simply annotate the deduced type in the scope.  Since
        variables are never redefined, this shouldn't be a big
        problem.

      - Closures are of course difficult.  No idea how to handle
        those.

*** strength reduction, of sorts
    - The idea is that instead of (Dw winfo (offset == 0x123)), we
      would emit (Dw 0x123 dwarf_offdie), without dwarf_offdie
      actually being a word.  (This would also check that there _is_
      such DIE in the first place.)  winfo would expose a "reduction
      point", and the translator would make use of that.

      - winfo, unit, child: offset, ?root, maybe pos
      - attribute: label
      - address/T_DIE: other range ?overlap, maybe pos
      - (r)elem/T_SEQ: pos
      - (r)elem/T_LOCLIST_ELEM: pos, maybe offset
      - value/T_LOCLIST_OP: pos

    - This functionality would depend on overload pegging, so that you
      know which overload to ask for abbreviations.  But some of it
      could be doable in runtime as well, and might still very much
      pay off.

** command-line arguments -- $1, $2, ...
   - These would have to be passed in not only from command line, but
     also from the C/C++ wrapper.  Thus it is desirable that they can
     somehow become of various types.  E.g. we'd like to be able to
     pass in 17 without making it "17".

   - Systemtap has @1, @2, etc. for literals.  $1, $2, etc. are pasted
     verbatim (macro-expanded so to speak) and lexed and parsed.  This
     would allow the "17" be passed in as 17, but that's still
     awkward.

   - The wrapper (or command-line interface) should probably provide a
     map of values (as in, instances of a class value subclass).  Thus
     $1 could be spliced as 17 or "17" depending on what comes in.  $1
     could be similar to binding--maybe this could be modelled as an
     outermost scope (provided we solve the stack cloning performance
     issues).  Type inference would have to be done after these
     arguments are provided.

** Dictionaries
   - Maybe have a key-value value type?  And a => operator for
     constructing this?  The dictionary would then be:
     : [7 => 5, 8 => "foo"]
     There would be words, key and value, which access parts of the
     pair.  Lookup would be done like:
     : [dictionary] elem (key == 7) value	# gimme 7's value
     Querying:
     : [dictionary] (elem key == 7)		# do we have key 7?
     Getting list of all keys:
     : [dictionary] [|D| D elem key]
     Add 1 to key X:
     : [dictionary] [|D| D elem (key => value (==X) 1 add || )]
     Add A=>B unless A already present:
     : [dictionary] (|D| if (D elem key == A) then D else [D elem, A=>B])
     Wow, that's a mouthful.

     Um, what does this do?
     : [(1, 2, 3) => ("a", "b", "c")]
     I think it should be this:
     : [1 => "a", 1 => "b", 1 => "c", 2 => "a", ...]
     ... which actually shows that list of key-val pairs is no
     dictionary, or actually that it's a multi-set sort of thing.

** @AT_MIPS_linkage_name â€” translated to @AT_linkage_name automatically
** XXX @AT_stmt_list

   @AT_stmt_list yields a number of nodes of type line_table_entry.
   The following words (which are thin wrappers around similarly named
   libdw functions) are applicable to individual line table entries:

   : address
   : @lineop_index
   : @lineno (or @AT_decl_line ???)
   : @linecol (or @AT_decl_column ???)
   : @linebeginstatement, ?linebeginstatement, !linebeginstatement
   : @lineendsequence, ?lineendsequence, !lineendsequence
   : @lineblock, ?lineblock, !lineblock
   : @lineprologueend, ?lineprologueend, !lineprologueend
   : @lineepiloguebegin, ?lineepiloguebegin, !lineepiloguebegin
   : @lineisa
   : @linediscriminator

   The operators that return a boolean constant come also in assertion
   variant so that it's easy to filter interesting line table entries.

   XXX That's however not entirely consistent with how DW_FORM_flag*
   attributes behave.  For those, ?AT_* always means, is this
   attribute present, and never, is the value true.  Needs some more
   thinking to consolidate this.  Maybe we could abandon the @op's for
   these and just expose ?op's.  When ?x is present, it implies that
   @op is true.

** XXX .debug_frame, .eh_frame
   - do we need an overarching "theory" for both of these?
   - also, there's fair amount of tables around here (symbol tables,
     line tables, ...).  Does it make sense to understand them as
     first-class citizen of some sort?  Currently we understand there
     are values, every value has some properties, and some values have
     attributes.

** XXX multithreading
   - processing Dwarf has the potential for a lot of concurrency.  If
     locks end up serializing, we might actually open the Dwarf in
     each thread anew, and see if that helps.

** floats
   - These are currently represented as blocks.  libdw doesn't give us
     any support decoding these, and it seems to be not entirely
     trivial--endian issues, different encodings, and such.

     E.g. on x86_64, __float128 type claims to be 10 bytes, but the
     block is 16 bytes long.  long double claims to be 10 bytes as
     well, the block is 16 bytes as well, but aligned so that only the
     first ten bytes are used.

     Seems like a fair can of worms.  Is it worth it?

** proper decoding of DW_ATE_UTF
   - Decode as UTF-8?  Or do we need a wchar_t string?  Also, C++
     should have conversion facets for 16-bit and 32-bit character
     types, but that's not implemented in GCC yet.

** stateful list iteration
   - We need fold or something so that it's reasonably easy to
     express sum (and whatever else).  Currently:
     : let sum := {0 (over elem (pos == 0) add
     : 	              swap [|A| A elem (pos != 0)] swap)*
     :             swap (== []) drop};

** statistics?
   akin to systemtap?  locstat would certainly use them.
